# SRL-EMPLOYMENT-ANALYSIS
In this exercise, you're working with employee data from a company called SRL. The dataset contains detailed information about each employee, including their personal details, job role, salary, performance, attendance, and employment history.

## OVERVIEW 

This exercise focuses on analyzing HR data from the company SRL to support better decision-making in talent management. Using Tableau, you're asked to create an interactive dashboard based on employee information such as job roles, salaries, performance, satisfaction, and demographics. The goal is to help the Human Resources team identify key patterns—like hiring trends, reasons for employee turnover, and department-level performance- so they can foster a more inclusive, productive, and data-driven workplace. The final deliverables include publishing your dashboard on Tableau Public and documenting your findings in a GitHub repository.
